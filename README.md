# SAWS
This repository is an implementation for paper "Modeling the Incongruity between Sentence Snippets for Sarcasm Detection".
To run the code, you just need to follow the below steps:
1. Due to the space limit, we didn't put the GloVe word embeddings here. You can download from  http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
2. Put the file "glove.6B.100d.txt" under data directory.
3. Install all the packages which are required by the code.
3. Edit the config.py file to change the hyper-parameters.
4. Type python main.py to run the codes.
5. The model will be saved under model directory
6. The training loss will be stored in loss_record folder
